export KAMIWAZA_EXTENSION_STAGE=LOCAL

# Choose one of the following options:

# Option 1: HTTPS server (recommended for team sharing)
# Uncomment and update with your server URL:
# export KAMIWAZA_EXTENSION_LOCAL_STAGE_URL=https://localhost:58888

# Uncomment and update with the absolute path to this package:
